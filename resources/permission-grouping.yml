# PlayerVaults v3.1.0

# This feature aims to reduce the number of permissions being assigned to
# each group/player.
#
# Example:
# permissions:
#   some.permission.here: 12
#
# The above permissions configuration will grant players that have the
# permission "some.permission.here" access to all vaults from 1 to 12
# (i.e: /pv 1, /pv 2, /pv 3, .../pv 12)

# Whether to enable permission grouping
enabled: false
